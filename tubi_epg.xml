Yugi and the Pharaoh become hesitant to duel, not wanting to harm the good Marik. As he fades away, Marik appears to an unconscious Odion, thanks him for taking care of him and apologizes, wishing that he could take back his cruel actions. In a cliffhanger, Odion is revealed to have been awakened by Marik's apology.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250607160000 +0000" stop="20250607163000 +0000"><title>Skylanders Academy</title><desc>The young Skylanders serve a day of guard duty at Cloudcracker Prison.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250607163000 +0000" stop="20250607170000 +0000"><title>Skylanders Academy</title><desc>After battling Kaos, Stealth Elf finds herself caught inside his mind and must find a way to escape.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250607170000 +0000" stop="20250607173000 +0000"><title>Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures</title><desc>It looks like Betrayus' fortunes are changing when he summons a Nether-Witch to curse Pac Man with bad luck.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250607173000 +0000" stop="20250607180000 +0000"><title>Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures</title><desc>Dr. Buttocks lures a giant Ghosteroidto threaten PacWorld, and Pac-Man must grow to planet proportions to save the day.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250607180000 +0000" stop="20250607183000 +0000"><title>Super Mario Bros 3</title><desc>Hip and Hop Koopa steal Prince Mushroomkamen's case which the Queen got angry and is looking for her son, meanwhile Mario and co are in Desert Land which the Queen mistakes Mario for her son and the heroes must get the case back. /</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250607183000 +0000" stop="20250607190000 +0000"><title>Super Mario Bros 3</title><desc>Toad loses a magic wand to the Koopas. / When the Mario Brothers go back to Brooklyn, they are mistaken as babysitters to look after Junior.

As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards. Kaiba then activates the Duel Tower's self-destruct sequence, giving everybody one hour to get off the island before it explodes.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250607200000 +0000" stop="20250607203000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh!</title><desc>Yugi and the gang escape from the island in time, but they are forced to leave Kaiba and Mokuba behind.
